unset SHELL
exit

unset 

*BOOM
(of course its my ft_strlen that it)

cat 


^c
minishell> minishell> 

unset ""
exit
^invalid free

echo hi >> sami/shimi

(shoudnt work)




After doing unset LANG it also unsets LANGUAGE *sobs*



printf 'hello world' >/dev/null | cat -e 

when outfile has a / it doesnt redirect and just prints when it shouldnt
